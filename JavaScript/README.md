# JavaScript

## What It Is
- a programming language that runs in your browser
- was once used for simple things like hiding/showing content, but has become more and more important for web development
- React is kind of the pinnacle of this trend, where almost everything is being done in JavaScript.

## Estimated Timeline
My goal is to spend roughly 3 weeks on JavaScript. But this is only an estimated outline, we'll be going at whatever pace the class as a whole thinks is best, so that everyone understands the material as we go.

## Tools

### Extensions for Visual Studio Code
- Live Server
- Bracket Pair Colorizer 2

# Resources

The book we'll be using to learn JavaScript is [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/). It's free to read through that site or to download and read in whatever format you choose (e.g. PDF). Unless it's stated otherwise, all of the assigned readings given for the lessons below are from this book.
