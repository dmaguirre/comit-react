ComIT Course on React

## What is React?
- a JavaScript framework
- used for doing front-end web development
- created by Facebook engineers
- hugely popular
- very well-liked by developers

## What We'll Need to Learn
Since React is used for web development, first we're going to have to learn about web development.
Modern front-end web development is based on three core technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### HTML
- a markup language that the browser reads, and then renders that markup into what is displayed on the screen.
- holds the content of the document, like text, links, images, etc. 

### CSS
- a language for describing the visual styling and appearance of HTML documents.
- used for text formatting, backgrounds, colors, borders, etc.

### JavaScript
- a programming language that runs in your browser
- was once used for simple things like hiding/showing content, but has become more and more important for web development
- React is kind of the pinnacle of this trend, where almost everything is being done in JavaScript.

My goal is to roughly spend 3 weeks on HTML and CSS, 3 weeks on JavaScript, which would leave 6 weeks for React and any other material I think is important for a software developer to know. But this is only an estimated outline, we'll be going at whatever pace the class as a whole thinks is best, so that everyone understands the material as we go.

## Lessons
The lessons aren't broken down by class or any particular length of time. When I finish one lesson, I'll just move on to the next one, unless there isn't much time left in that class.
