# ComIT React Course

## What is React?
- a JavaScript framework
- used for doing front-end web development
- created by Facebook engineers
- [hugely popular](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-web-frameworks)
- [very well-liked by developers](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-web-frameworks)

## What We'll Need to Learn
Since React is used for web development, first we're going to have to learn about web development.
Modern front-end web development is based on three core technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### HTML
- a markup language that the browser reads, and then renders that markup into what is displayed on the screen.
- holds the content of the document, like text, links, images, etc. 

### CSS
- a language for describing the visual styling and appearance of HTML documents.
- used for text formatting, backgrounds, colors, borders, etc.

### JavaScript
- a programming language that runs in your browser
- was once used for simple things like hiding/showing content, but has become more and more important for web development
- React is kind of the pinnacle of this trend, where almost everything is being done in JavaScript.

My goal is to roughly spend 3 weeks on HTML and CSS, 3 weeks on JavaScript, which would leave 6 weeks for React and any other material I think is important for a software developer to know. But this is only an estimated outline, we'll be going at whatever pace the class as a whole thinks is best, so that everyone understands the material as we go.

## Expectations
Three months isn't a lot of time to learn web development and React from scratch, so things will move quickly. During class, I'll be stopping to ask if everyone is understanding the lesson so far, and to see if anyone has any questions. Please use these opportunities whenever you need to! Since you're all assumed to be brand-new at this, there aren't any bad questions in this course. Outside of class, please utilize our Slack channel for getting help.

I'll be providing readings and assignments here. I won't be checking if you completed the reading, but you'll only be making things more difficult for yourself if you don't. The assignments are for you to test your understanding and skills, so you won't be submitting them, but this is the best way for you to really learn the material.

The most important skills to develop are problem-solving and self-learning. I'm happy to provide help for anyone who needs it, but it's important to try different things, experiment, and use the internet as a resource. There's nothing I know that you can't find on the internet!

## Tools
### Editor
You'll need an editor for writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although there are a lot of great options out there, I strongly encourage you to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). It's now by far the most popular editor for front-end web development, and it has great functionality. There are also a ton of great extensions available, which I'll explain how to install, and some of which I'll be using:
- Live Server
- Bracket Pair Colorizer 2
- colorize
- CSS Peek
- JS Refactor

### Browser
I'll be using Chrome, mostly because it's currently the most popular browser and it has good development tools. But you're free to use whatever browser you want, although keep that in mind if what you see isn't exactly the same as how it looks in my demos.

Whatever browser you use, you'll need to get familiar with its developer tools. On Chrome, hit F12 to bring them up. I'll briefly go over the most important parts, like the Elements, Console, and Network tabs. 

### Git
We'll be using git for source control. I'll be giving a brief tutorial on git and git commands, and you're free to either use a terminal or a GUI program like [GitHub Desktop](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop). 

# Lessons
The lessons aren't broken down by class or any particular length of time. When I finish one lesson, I'll just move on to the next one, unless there isn't much time left in that class.
