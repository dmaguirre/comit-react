# ComIT React Course

## What is React?
- a JavaScript framework
- used for doing front-end web development
- created by Facebook engineers
- [hugely popular](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-web-frameworks)
- [very well-liked by developers](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-web-frameworks)


My goal is to spend roughly 3 weeks React, which would leave 3 weeks for any other material I think is important for a software developer to know. But this is only an estimated outline, we'll be going at whatever pace the class as a whole thinks is best, so that everyone understands the material as we go.
